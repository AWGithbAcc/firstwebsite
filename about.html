<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Here's some information about me!</h2>

<p style="font-size: 25px">My name is Arthur Watson, and I am a dedicated and passionate web designer as well as a graphic designer with a strong enthusiasm for creativity and innovation. I take pride in not only building from existing foundations but also in pushing boundaries to explore new and original ideas. What excites me most about design is the opportunity to create something fresh whether that means developing a sleek, modern website, crafting unique visual identities, or finding new ways to bring concepts to life through design.</p>
	
<p style="font-size: 25px">I thrive on productivity and love immersing myself fully in my work. No matter the challenge, I approach each project with determination and adaptability, always ready to refine and improve until I arrive at the best possible outcome. When problems arise, I don’t view them as setbacks, but rather as opportunities to learn, grow, and develop innovative solutions. My resilience allows me to stay focused for as long as it takes to achieve success, and I never shy away from putting in the time and effort required to see a vision through to completion.</p>

	
<h2 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center">Some things I love to do!</h2>	

<img src="water.jpg" alt="mountain" height="200px" width="200px" style="float: right; margin-right: 15px; border-style: solid;  border-radius: 10px;">
	
<div style="background-color: #D3D3D3; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, white, #d3d3d3);">
	 
<p style="font-size: 25px">Some things I truly enjoy doing in my free time include swimming and cooking, both of which bring me a sense of relaxation and happiness. Swimming is probably my favorite activity, especially during the summer months. Having a pool in my backyard makes it really easy for me to spend time in the water whenever I want, and I love how refreshing and energizing it feels. Whether I’m swimming laps for exercise or just floating and enjoying the sunshine, being in the water has always been one of the best ways for me to unwind and have fun.</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px">Another activity I love is cooking. Food has always been an important part of my family life, so I spend a lot of time helping my family prepare meals for the house. I really enjoy working alongside them, learning new recipes, and experimenting with different flavors and techniques. Every once in a while, I like to make something just for myself, and there’s something really satisfying about putting time and effort into a dish and then getting to enjoy it right away. Cooking for me isn’t just about eating it’s about the process, the creativity, and the joy of turning raw ingredients into something delicious.</p>
